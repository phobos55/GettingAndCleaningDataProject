GettingAndCleaningDataProject
=============================
This is the repo for the final project for Getting and Cleaning Data Course.

This repo contains the following files and folders. 
* **run_analysis.R** The r script processes the data and generated the required tidy dataset for submission. That does the following.   
1.-  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2.-  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
3.-  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
4.-  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.   
5.-  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  
* **data** This folder contains the input data, which downloads from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. 
* **CodeBook.md** A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
* **README.md** The README file for this repo.
